// CACHEDPTR CLASSES
// ACTIONCACHEDHANDLE<TYPE>
// A cached handle is something that should not exist in the ation but is there to accelerate
// the performance of the code. For instance when loading a file the UI needs to read the file
// up front before being able to present the user with options. In such a case the importer could
// use the already read data block and significantly speed up the file load, when the action is
// finally issued. However the logic in the action SHOULD NOT depend on these data, as a script
// may not have read the data yet and would require it to be read first. Hence we have cached handle
// objects that contain hints to improve performance. However these hints will be deleted as soon
// as the action finishes.

// Base class needed for uniform delete the auxillary handles in the object
