Installation Guide
==================

This document is intended for people who like to build Seg3D for Linux or build Seg3D from source. 
If you use Windows or Mac OS X, please download the prepackaged installers, which will guide you
through the installation process.


Installing Seg3D from source
============================

Compiler Requirements:
----------------------

Windows XP, Vista, and 7: The current source code was optimized for use with Visual Studio (VS2008 
or higher). The code should compile fine using the Visual Studio Express versions as well. The code
has not been tested under Cygwin or MinGW compilers.

OS X: The source code base was using under Xcode as well as using make/gcc and works for both 
environments.  

LINUX: The code base has been tested for use with GCC and this is the recommended compiler for
linux.


Dependencies:
-------------

Before building Seg3D, please make sure that Qt 4.7 or higher has been installed on your system. For
windows a Visual Studio binary build is available that can be installed on a windows system. To our
knowledge the Windows Visual Studio development libraries are only available in 32bits. In case of a
64bit version, you would have to build Qt under Visual Studio from scratch. This can be done easily
by downloading the source code version, configuring it as described on the Qt webpage and compiling
the code from scratch. For Mac OS X, there Qt binaries as well, there is a Carbon (32bit) and Cocao
(64bit) build available on the Qt website. At the time of writing these instructions the 64bit 
version is not the default download, but it is available on the download page after choosing to 
download the Mac OS X version. Both the 32bit and 64bit version will work with Seg3D. As OS X 10.5 
and 10.6 by default will build 64bit programs, one should want to install the 64bit version of Qt.
For Linux Qt is available in most package managers. Most likely Qt was already installed on your 
system, however it is likely to be an older version than Qt 4.7. Hence download and compile the
Qt 4.7 development package using your favorite package manager if you wish to install Seg3D on your
Linux system.


Compiling Seg3D:
----------------

Once you have obtained a compatible compiler and installed Qt 4.7 on your system, you need to 
download and install Cmake ( www.cmake.org ) to actually build the software. CMake is a platform
independent configuring system that is used for generating makefiles, Visual Studio project files,
or Xcode project files. Once CMake has been installed you need to point CMake at the master 
CMakeLists.txt file in the src directory and specify a bin directory in which the program should be
build. Once the input directory (src) and the output directory (bin) have been specified, please 
configure the project. At this stage you may be prompted to specify your location of the Qt 4.7
installation. If you installed Qt in the default location, it should find Qt automatically. After
configuration is done, generate the make files for your favorite development environment and run
the make system.


That should be all. For questions and issues regarding building the software from source,
