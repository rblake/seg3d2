	Hide the abort message (if aborted).  This is a workaround for the fact that this action is
	not run on a separate algorithm thread, so the LayerWidget::trigger_abort() posts an action to
	show the abort message and this event is put on the event queue and not processed until this
	run function returns.  The problem is that the last event processed is the one showing the 
	abort message, so the abort message never goes away.  We work around this by posting our own
	hide abort message event (via the Action dispatch mechanism) that will get placed in the queue
	after the show message.  

	Normally for other filters the abort message is hidden when the layer's data_state_ changes, 
	e.g. from PROCESSING_C to AVAILABLE_C.  That state change does happen in 
	MaskLayer::compute_isosurface(), but then the action to show the abort message 
	gets processed afterward due to the scenario described above.

	Put another way, normally the "Waiting for process to abort message" is displayed while we wait
	for the filter algorithm thread to abort.  In this case there is no separate algorithm thread
	to wait for because the isosurface computation is done directly on the application thread.
