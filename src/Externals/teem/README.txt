=============== License information

See above.  This preamble should appear on all released files. Full
text of the Simple Library Usage License (SLUL) should be in the file
"LICENSE.txt" in the "src" directory.  The SLUL is the GNU Lesser
General Public License, plus an exception: statically-linked binaries
that link with Teem can be destributed under the terms of your choice,
with very modest provisions.  

=============== How to compile

Use CMake to compile Teem.  CMake is available from:

http://www.cmake.org/

There are some instructions for building Teem with CMake at:

http://teem.sourceforge.net/build.html

=============== Directory Structure

src/
  With one subdirectory for each of the teem libraries, all the 
  source for the libraries is in here.
include/
  Some short header files that are used to verify the correct
  setting of compiler variables, such as TEEM_ENDIAN.
include/teem/
  The include (.h) files for all the libraries (such as nrrd.h)
  get put here (but don't originate from here).  
irix6.64/
irix6.n32/
linux.32/
linux.64/
solaris/
cygwin/
darwin.32/
darwin.64/
  The architecture-dependent directories, with a name which exactly
  matches valid settings for the environment variable TEEM_ARCH.
  Within these directories there are:
    lib/  all libraries put both their static/archive (.a) and 
          shared/dynamic (.so) library files here (such as libnrrd.a)
    bin/  all libraries put their binaries here, hopefully in a way which
          doesn't cause name clashes
    obj/  make puts all the .o files in here, for all libraries. When
          compiling "dev", it also puts libraries here, so that "tests"
          can link against them there

See the README.txt in the "src" directory for library-specific
information.

=============== Code aesthetics

There are some matters of coding style which I try to hold myself too.
They are listed here primarily for my benefit, but I would hope that 
other people follow them as well if they contribute to teem.

aspects of GNU style (http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards.html) which I like:
(but don't necessarily always follow)
- avoid arbitrary limits on (memory) sizes of things (this is very hard)
- be robust about handling of non-ASCII input where ASCII is expected
- be super careful about handling of erroneous system call return,
  and always err on the side of being anal in matters of error detection
  and reporting.
- check every single malloc/calloc for NULL return
- make sure all symbols visible in the library
  start with "<lib>" or "_<lib>" where <lib> is the library name
- for expressions split on multiple lines, split before an operator, not after
- use parens on multi-line expressions to make them tidy
- Function comments should be in complete sentences, with two spaces after "."
- Try to avoid assignments inside if-conditional.

other:
- make sure that error detection code is as seperate as possible
  from code which gets something done (a sort of preamble of asserts)
- Spell-check all comments.
- No constants embedding in code- either use #defines or enums.
- to distinguish between a continuous (float) variable and one (int) which
  represents the same quantity, but discretized, suffix the int with "i" or
  "Idx":  "u" vs. "uIdx" or "u" vs. "ui"
- Try to avoid making local copies of variables in structs, just for
  the sake of code brevity when those variables won't change during
  the scope of the function.
- use "return" correctly: no parens!
- don't give biff carriage returns
- always use "biff" for error handling stuff
- if a pointer should be initialized to NULL, then set it to NULL;
  Don't assume that a pointer in a struct will be NULL following a calloc.
